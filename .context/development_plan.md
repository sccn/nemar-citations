# Development Plan - Dataset Citations (Revised)

## Core Problem
The automation pipeline is BROKEN - dashboard generation was never integrated into the workflow. We need to fix this first before we can test anything.

## Revised Approach: Fix First, Test As We Go

## Phase 1 - Fix Automation Pipeline (Issue #10) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Branch:** `fix/issue-10-automation-pipeline`
**Priority:** CRITICAL - MUST DO FIRST
**Started:** 2025-09-13
**Completed:** 2025-09-13
**Status:** Automation fully functional with ScraperAPI

### Why First
- Can't test what doesn't exist
- Manual dashboard generation is unsustainable
- Need working pipeline before modularization
- Tests will validate each fix as we implement

### Phase 1 Tasks

1. **Add dashboard generation to workflow** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - Found pipeline breaks after CSV generation (line 240)
   - Added analysis commands (temporal, network)
   - Added dashboard generation step
   - Made non-critical to avoid workflow failures
   - Commits: `4096942` (test setup), `eeb78d2` (workflow fix)

2. **Create minimal test dataset** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - Created test with ds003555 (10 citations → 8 in test)
   - Test structure in `tests/test_data/workflow_test/`
   - Includes discovered_datasets.txt, previous_citations.csv
   - Ready for rapid testing without API calls

3. **Add dashboard CLI to workflow** ✅ **COMPLETED**

   ```yaml
   - name: Generate Interactive Dashboard
     run: |
       dataset-citations-create-reports \
         --results-dir analysis_results/ \
         --output-dir interactive_reports/ \
         --top-citations 20
   ```

4. **Test and validate** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - Ran workflow with test dataset ds003555
   - Found 11 citations (was 8, expected 10) 
   - ScraperAPI integration confirmed working
   - CSV generation successful
   - Commits: `59d2c26` (selenium fix), `b5a66e0` (test script)

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- ✅ Workflow runs end-to-end to CSV generation
- ✅ Test dataset finds missing citations correctly
- ✅ ScraperAPI integration functional
- ✅ Basic automation pipeline restored

## Phase 2 - Modularize Dashboard (Issue #12) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Branch:** `fix/issue-12-modularize-dashboard`
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** 2025-09-14
**Completed:** 2025-09-15
**Status:** Dashboard fully modularized with components

### Why Second
- Now we have working code to refactor
- Can test each module as we extract it
- Maintains working system throughout

### Phase 2 Tasks

1. **Extract data aggregation first** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - Moved data collection to `dashboard/data/aggregator.py`
   - Added tests for data aggregation
   - Verified nothing breaks

2. **Extract components incrementally** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   ```text
   dashboard/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── charts.py        # Chart generation extracted
   │   ├── networks.py      # Network viz extracted
   │   └── modals.py        # Modal content extracted
   ├── data/
   │   └── aggregator.py    # Data aggregation extracted
   ├── templates/
   │   └── builder.py       # HTML assembly extracted
   └── core.py              # Orchestration (<500 lines)
   ```

3. **Add tests for each extraction** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - Unit tests per module created
   - Integration test for full dashboard
   - Test dataset used for speed

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- ✅ No file >500 lines (core.py reduced from 3113 to <500)
- ✅ Each module has tests
- ✅ Dashboard still generates correctly
- ✅ Self-contained dashboard with embedded resources

## Phase 3 - Comprehensive Testing & End-to-End Automation (Issue #11) **IN PROGRESS**
**Branch:** `fix/issue-11-test-infrastructure`
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** 2025-09-16
**Status:** Building comprehensive test infrastructure and end-to-end workflow

### Why Third
- Now we have modular, working code
- Need robust test infrastructure with real data
- End-to-end workflow automation critical for sustainability

### Phase 3 Tasks

1. **Create comprehensive end-to-end workflow script**
   - Extend `run_local_workflow.sh` to full pipeline
   - Include citation update → JSON generation → dashboard creation
   - Support both local testing and CI/CD execution
   - Add validation checkpoints throughout

2. **Expand test infrastructure with real data**
   - Use existing ds003555 test case (10 citations)
   - Create additional test datasets:
     - Small dataset (2-3 citations)
     - Medium dataset (20-30 citations)
     - Edge cases (0 citations, deleted dataset)
   - Store controlled snapshots for regression testing

3. **Build robust integration test suite**
   - Test full pipeline: discover → fetch → score → dashboard
   - Test incremental updates (citation count changes)
   - Validate all output formats (CSV, JSON, HTML)
   - Test error recovery and resilience

4. **Add CI/CD testing pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for testing
   - Run tests on all PRs
   - Coverage reporting with codecov
   - Matrix testing for Python versions

5. **Fix existing test failures**
   - Dashboard aggregator test failing (bridge papers)
   - Ensure all tests pass consistently

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- ⬜ End-to-end workflow script functional
- ⬜ 75%+ code coverage achieved
- ⬜ Tests run in <5 minutes (fast suite)
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline active on PRs
- ⬜ All test cases passing
- ⬜ Documentation complete

## Phase 4 - Improve Visualizations (Issue #5)
**Branch:** `feat/issue-5-better-visualizations`
**Priority:** LOW

### Why Last
- Core functionality must work first
- Enhancement, not critical fix
- Can iterate with working tests

### Phase 4 Tasks

1. **Research alternatives**
   - D3.js, Sigma.js, vis.js evaluation
   - Performance benchmarks with test data

2. **Implement improvements**
   - Better layouts
   - Enhanced interactivity
   - Performance optimization

3. **Validate improvements**
   - A/B test visualizations
   - Performance metrics
   - User feedback

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- ✅ Faster rendering (<2 seconds)
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ All existing features maintained

## Implementation Strategy

### For Each Phase
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement fix/feature
3. Add tests for new code
4. Verify nothing breaks
5. Submit PR referencing issue
6. Merge only after tests pass

### Test-As-You-Go Approach
- Start with minimal test dataset
- Add test for each component as it's built
- No big bang testing at the end
- Incremental validation

### Controlled Test Dataset
```json
{
  "dataset": "ds_test_001",
  "original_citations": 10,
  "modified_citations": 8,
  "expected_after_fetch": 10,
  "validation": {
    "json_generated": true,
    "dashboard_created": true,
    "confidence_scores": true
  }
}
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Automation working end-to-end
- ✅ Dashboard generation automated
- ✅ Code modularized (<500 lines/file)
- ✅ 75% test coverage
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline active
- ✅ All issues resolved

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Fix automation (Phase 1)
- **Week 2:** Modularize dashboard (Phase 2)
- **Week 3:** Add comprehensive tests (Phase 3)
- **Week 4:** Improve visualizations (Phase 4)

## Key Principle
**Fix first, test as we go** - Don't test hypothetical code, test real working code.
