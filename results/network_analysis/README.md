## Key Findings

### Multi-Dataset Citation Analysis
- **82 papers** cite multiple BIDS datasets simultaneously
- Shows cross-dataset research patterns and methodological studies
- Identifies papers that validate methods across multiple datasets

### Dataset Co-Citation Network
- **601 co-citation relationships** between datasets
- Reveals which datasets are commonly used together in research
- Shows research domain clustering (e.g., visual cortex studies, language processing)

### Author Influence Network
- **87 influential authors** identified by citation impact
- Measures influence through cumulative citations to their papers
- Identifies key researchers bridging dataset creation and usage

### Bridge Papers
- **82 papers** identified as research area connectors
- Papers that cite datasets from different research domains
- Critical for understanding interdisciplinary research patterns

## How to Reproduce

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Neo4j is running with data loaded
dataset-citations-load-graph

# Activate environment
conda activate dataset-citations
```

### Generate Network Analysis
```bash
# Run complete network analysis
dataset-citations-analyze-networks

# Results will be saved to:
# - results/network_analysis/csv_exports/
# - results/network_analysis/summary_reports/
```

### Query Neo4j Directly
```cypher
// Example: Find papers citing multiple datasets
MATCH (p:Paper)-[:CITES]->(d:Dataset)
WITH p, COUNT(d) as dataset_count
WHERE dataset_count > 1
RETURN p.title, dataset_count
ORDER BY dataset_count DESC
```

## Analysis Details

### Confidence Filtering
- Only citations with confidence scores â‰¥ 0.4 are included
- Ensures high-quality citation-dataset relationships
- Reduces noise from false positive matches

### Temporal Scope
- Analysis covers citations from early 2000s to 2025
- Temporal evolution tracks network changes over time
- Useful for understanding research trend evolution

### Statistical Significance
- Co-citation strength measured by frequency of joint citations
- Author influence calculated using citation impact scores
- Bridge detection uses graph centrality measures
