## Limitations and Considerations

### Data Completeness
- **Author name variations**: May lead to author splitting or merging issues
- **Affiliation changes**: Authors moving between institutions over time
- **International name variations**: Different naming conventions across cultures
- **Publication database coverage**: Varying coverage of different publication venues

### Bias Considerations
