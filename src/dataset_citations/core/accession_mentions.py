"""Merge accession-mention citations into a dataset's citation JSON.

Accession-mention citations (papers that name the dataset accession in text)
are discovered by `backends/accession_search.py` and folded into the same
`citation_details[]` list as anchor-based citations, each tagged
`discovery_method="accession_mention"`. The toggle (#169) buckets:
  - "cites dataset"   = accession mentions + anchor citations whose
                        source_relation is IsVersionOf / IsIdenticalTo
  - "cites data paper"= the remaining anchor citations (References /
                        IsDerivedFrom / IsDescribedBy)

`IsDescribedBy` (a data paper that describes the dataset, e.g. the on000117
data paper) is intentionally NOT in `_DATASET_RELATIONS`: its citations are
citations of the data paper, not of the dataset record itself.

This module is pure (no network / I/O) and deterministic so repeated runs are
content-idempotent (issue #165). Issue #169.

      existing accession-mention entry is left untouched (idempotent).

    - When new mentions are appended, the stale top-level `confidence_scoring`
      block is dropped so the downstream score step (its `--skip-existing`
      skips files that already carry the block) re-scores the dataset.

      and the per-bucket breakdown.
