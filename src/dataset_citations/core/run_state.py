"""Per-stage `{dataset_id: last_checked_iso}` caches backing freshness gates.

Pipeline stages that hit a rate-limited external API (`cli/update.py` against
opencite, `cli/find_mentions.py` against OpenAlex) skip datasets they checked
recently. The timestamp driving that gate is kept in a gitignored sidecar next
to the citation JSONs rather than inside them: `date_last_updated` in the
committed JSON means "last content change" (issue #165), so it cannot double as
the freshness signal without churning every diff.

Each stage owns its own state file so their windows advance independently.
